# Fruit-defect-detection-using-deep-learning
Fruit defect detection using deep learning aims to identify and classify defects in fruits to improve quality control and reduce manual inspection efforts. YOLOv8(You Only Look Once version 8) is a state-of-the-art object detection model well-suited for this task due to its high accuracy,speed and ability to detect multiple defects in a single inference.
